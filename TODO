Bugs:
    ☐ Class '.app--no-scroll', activated when menu is open in mobile, removes the scrollbar, which shifts the background text while the menu opens @created(19-09-14 21:18)
    ☐ Main content area should be visible if menu is forced open via mobile and then expanded to tablet/desktop @created(19-09-14 21:19)
    View Transition:
        - If scroll down while new page is loading off screen, after page loads and scroll positiong is mid-page
            the h1 (section titles) lie behind the gradients. They should be in front of their header gradients.
            1. Automatically scroll to top of page while view is transitioning in
            2. Fix z-index interaction between sticky header and relative title
                - Forcing new z-indexes after enter doesn't work
    ☐ Page header gradient flashes over title when hover over main menu @created(19-09-18 21:17)
        - Open About
        - Scroll to second title
        - Hover over main menu
        - Observe gradient revealing itself
